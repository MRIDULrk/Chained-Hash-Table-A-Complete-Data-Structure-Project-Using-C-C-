# Chained Hash Table: A Complete Data Structure Project Using C & C++

Introduction:
A hash table is a data structure that efficiently stores and retrieves data from memory. There are many ways to construct a hash table. One is Open Hashing (Close Addressing) and another is Closed Hashing (Open Addressing). We will be using Open Hashing (chaining method) using the Divisor Method. Because Open Hashing contains chaining and we are implementing chained hash table.

An object is stored in a hash table by associating it with a key. Input a data to hash table, we use divisor method for finding hash key. In most cases the hashing process computes a number. It is done for faster inputing data and access to element. The efficiency of mapping depends on the efficiency of the hash method used. In a hash table, data is stored in link List by help of array indexing, where each data value has its own unique node address but multiple data value has same array index because of chaining hash. Access of data becomes very fast if we know the index of the desired data.
Let a hash function H(x) maps the value x at the key index x%10 in an array. For example if the list of values is [11, 12, 13, 14, 15] it will stored at position {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} in the hash table.
